Analyze mean deviations to understand variations within and between zones.\nDetailed Plan:\n\nUse the zonnan_temps.csv dataset to answer questions.\nTransform data from wide format to long format:\n\nCreate a new column called “zones”.\nMerge all eight variables related to zones (EQ-24N, 24N-44N, 44N-64N, 64N-90N, EQ-24S, 24S-44S, 44S-64S, 64S-90S) into the “zones” column.\n\nResulting data frame will have three columns:\n\nYear\nZone\nAnomalies.\n\n\nReferring to Question 2:\nLatitude-based Temperature Anomalies: Create a heat map to visualize anomalies across latitude ranges and seasonal changes.

This suggests that the impacts of climate change are global, affecting both hemispheres and all seasons, albeit to varying degrees.\nThe graph also allows us to compare the temperature anomalies of different seasons within each hemisphere. For instance, we can see if winters are becoming warmer or summers are becoming hotter over time. This could provide insights into the shifting patterns of seasons and their potential effects on human livelihoods. For example, warmer winters could affect the hibernation patterns of animals, while hotter summers could lead to more frequent and severe heatwaves, impacting human health and agriculture.\n\n\nHeatmaps\nNow, we are going in detail, exploring the variations of seasonal temperature anomalies over the years. For this we have made a facet of heat maps, “Temperature Anomalies in Northern and Southern Hemisphere over the years”.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# Determine the overall range of temperature anomalies\noverall_range &lt;- range(comprehensive_df$Average_Temperature_Anomaly, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Combine NH and SH heatmaps into one plot\ncombined_heatmap &lt;- ggplot(comprehensive_df %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Average_Temperature_Anomaly)), \n                           aes(x = Season, y = Year, fill = Average_Temperature_Anomaly)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"#648FFF\", mid = \"white\", high = \"#FE6100\", midpoint = 0, limits = overall_range) +\n  labs(title = \"Temperature Anomalies in Northern and Southern Hemispheres over the years\",\n       x = \"Season\",\n       y = \"Year\",\n       fill = \"Temperature Anomaly\",\n       caption = \"Source: TidyTuesday(2023), Global Surface Temperature\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Hemisphere, ncol = 2)\n\n# Display the combined heatmap\ncombined_heatmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe y-axis for each of the graphs is the four seasons – Fall, Spring, Summer, Winter. The x-axis being the years 1880-2020. The color gradient from blue to red indicates the range of temperature anomalies, with blue being below their mean (-ve anomalies) and red being above their mean (+ve anomalies).\nFrom the maps we can observe that warmer colors have significantly started to appear in the northern hemisphere from the 1920’s itself whereas in southern hemisphere the reds started to appear from the 1960’s showing that the northern hemisphere started getting warmer way earlier. Which makes sense considering industrialization first began in the northern hemisphere itself.\n\n\nWorld Maps\nHere, we have extended our analysis by using geom polygons to overlap Seasonal temperature anomalies over the world map, used facet wrap to combine the seasons of a year, and repeated this for three specific years namely 1880, 1951, 2022. In each of the graph, we have four seasons, in each season we have a world map with latitudinal zones marked and the color gradient through the zones depict how the temperature anomalies have varied through the zones.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(maps)\n\n# set theme for ggplot2\nggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal(base_size = 11))\n\n# set width of code output\noptions(width = 65)\n\n# set figure parameters for knitr\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  fig.width = 12,        #

Which means the temperatures have either been their mean value or have gone below it but never exceeded. All in all, we can say it did not get warmer in 1880. Also, the summers of northern hemisphere have been warmer, and the winters have been colder than southern hemisphere.\nIn the second graph, “Temperature Anomaly 1951”, we can observe that the color gradient depicts zero, negative and positive temperature anomalies. Which means the temperatures have been both above and below their mean value. Overall, the northern hemisphere has warmer colors which means the temperatures have risen above their mean (it got warmer) here, and the southern hemisphere has solid colors which means temperatures have fallen below their mean (it got colder) here.\nIn the third graph, “Temperature Anomaly 2022”, we can observe that the color gradient only depicts either zero or positive temperature anomalies. Which means the temperatures have either been their mean value or have gone above it but never decreased. All in all, we can say it only got warmer in 2022. Also, all the seasons of northern hemisphere have been warmer than the southern hemisphere."

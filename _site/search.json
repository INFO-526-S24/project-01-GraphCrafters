Analyze differences in temperature patterns between hemispheres.\ncsv file to be used: nh_temps.csv and sh_temps.csv\nNote: For the questions where multiple csv files are used, the ‘year’ column will be used to join the columns (using inner_join()) and change the names (if required) and then work on the plots.\nAnalysis and Interpretation: Evaluate trends and patterns to identify regions experiencing significant anomalies. Upon analyzing the variations in different visualizations, we would be able to infer the effect of temperature anomalies on human livelihood for example in agriculture, tourism, health and global warming and discuss strategic adjustments to mitigate climate changes and work on technology advancements to improve in the future."

Analyze spatial patterns to identify regions most affected by climate change.\nGlobal Temperature Visualization: Utilize ggmap to overlay temperature data onto a global map. Incorporate geographic features to contextualize temperature variations.\nHemispheric Comparisons: Construct side-by-side box plots to compare hemispheric anomalies. Analyze differences in temperature patterns between hemispheres.\nDetailed Plan:\n\nObtain nh_temps.csv and sh_temps.csv datasets.\nConvert each dataset to long format:\n\nCreate a new column for each month (Jan, Feb, …, Nov, Dec).\nInclude a column for hemispheres (NH and SH).\nAdd a column for temperature anomalies.\n\nMerge the two data frames obtained from the CSV files vertically to create one comprehensive data frame.\nFor seasonal analysis:\n\nDefine variables for the four seasons: DJF (Winter), MAM (Spring), JJA (Summer), and SON (Fall) in the northern hemisphere.\nCreate a season column and merge the four seasons into it.\n\nFinally, the comprehensive data frame should have four columns:\n\nYear\nSeason\nHemisphere (Northern or Southern)\nTemperature anomalies.\n\n\nAnalysis and Interpretation: Evaluate trends and patterns to identify regions experiencing significant anomalies. Upon analyzing the variations in different visualizations, we would be able to infer the effect of temperature anomalies on human livelihood for example in agriculture, tourism, health and global warming and discuss strategic adjustments to mitigate climate changes and work on technology advancements to improve in the future."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nThis project utilizes R programming and libraries such as tidyverse, ggplot2, and ggmap to analyze NASA datasets on global surface temperature anomalies.\nIt explores temperature trends across regions and seasons, encompassing global, Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, and zonal anomalies.\nThrough preprocessing and visualization techniques including boxplots, heatmaps, and geographical maps, the project identifies trends and patterns in temperature anomalies.\nBy comparing hemispheres, examining seasonal variations, and assessing standard deviations across latitudinal zones, the analysis enhances understanding of climate change impacts on global temperatures.\nThe project’s visualizations and analyses contribute valuable insights to the discourse on climate change, aiding researchers, policymakers, and the public in addressing environmental challenges."
